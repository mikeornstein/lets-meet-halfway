# lets-meet-halfway
a project motivated by compromise! 

## why
we like seing our friends
our friends are sometimes far away
we could alternate to see who deals with all the LA traffic
or, we could meet halfway.
Travel times and distances are not well correlated,
nor are our roads very systematic.

So, how do we figure out how to share the burden of travel?

## enter: lets meet halfway
the idea is simple:
 - given two addresses, where is a central spot to meet up?
 - you should be able to see on the map the "lines of equal agony"
a couple interface ideas:
- how long are you willing to drive?
- how unequal are you willing to make it?
questions:
- can you visualize the isochrones?
- is time really better than distance?
- should optimize for distance, "CO2", time?
